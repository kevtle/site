      <description>Hey y’all! My name’s Kevin and I’m a junior biology student at the University of Texas at Austin.  I’m currently pursuing a B.S.A. in Biology with a minor in studio art.  I am going to be applying to optometry school soon – so wish me luck! My career goal is to open up my own private practice eye clinic one day. I think eyes are super neat, and I am determined to work hard in order to better serve my community in the future.</description>
