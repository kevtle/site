##Hey y'all!

#####My name's Kevin and I'm a junior biology student at the University of Texas at Austin. 

#####I'm currently pursuing a B.S.A. in Biology with a minor in studio art. 
#####I am going to be applying to optometry school soon -- so wish me luck! My career goal is to open up my own private practice eye clinic one day. I think eyes are super neat, and I am determined to work hard in order to better serve my community in the future. 

#####Outside of academia, my passions include: drawing, painting, cooking, spending time with friends, and surfing the internet!

#####Ever since the quarantine started, I've been cooking up a bunch of foods. I think I've become a part-time food blogger at this point. Here's a collage of some of the dishes I've made:

#####Although I would really like to showcase a pet, I don't have any (yet) :(
#####I dream of getting a dog one day, so in the meantime, please enjoy this picture of a maltese I found on the internet!
